ORGANIZE FILE STRUCTURE
	projects->ionchannels->other.cation.channels->docs,geneset,phylo,000.command.txt
		keep fastas in the geneset folder
		all commands are in this file
		keep external materials (downloads, presupplied files) in docs
		keep all alignments and phylogenetic trees in phylo

PREPARE THE CANDIDATE GENESET

fasta files
	../ionchannels/other.cation.channels/geneset
	consult with Eric about the ASC genes
create "candidate.geneset.full.unsafe.fa" -> contains all the fasta files in one single fasta file (note: contains asc.fasta. the accuracy of the information is uncertain)
	use 'cat * > candidate.geneset.full.unsafe.fa'

create "candidate.geneset.fa" -> contains only orai and p2rx fasta files
	use 'cat orai.fasta p2rx.fasta > candidate.geneset.fa'
